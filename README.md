Hello everyone! Our team Radiant-Riders have successfully done this project on Smart Bio-Adhesive MXene Hydrogel for Implant Integration as part of our participation for IIIT Sricity's Hackathon.This projects has it's Machine Learning Model trained and fine tuned from datasets(from Kaggle) and self made datasets from a collection of datasets which have been taken from Pubnet,etc.
                    With this we can get to quicker Idea and how our project stands out is that it doesn't require any login credentials (well offcourse it can be done when it comes in a business perspective) and can be accessed from your own device.
